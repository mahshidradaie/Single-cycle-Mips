This project implements a single-cycle MIPS processor using Verilog, designed to execute each instruction in a single clock cycle. The processor supports a subset of the MIPS instruction set, including arithmetic, logical, memory access, and control flow instructions. Key components such as the ALU, register file, instruction memory, data memory, and control unit are integrated to function cohesively within one clock cycle. Simulation and testing were conducted to verify functionality and ensure accurate instruction execution.
